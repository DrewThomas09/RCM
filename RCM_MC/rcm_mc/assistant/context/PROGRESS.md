# PEdesk Guide page-context — PROGRESS

**Date:** 2026-05-22

## Language adaptation
Spec was TypeScript/Node; PEdesk is pure Python (no Node toolchain).
Implemented in Python under `rcm_mc/assistant/context/` per the spec's
"adapt paths to match the codebase" instruction. TS interfaces →
dataclasses; string-union types → `Enum`s; `npm`/`tsx` validator → a
runnable Python module + a pytest.

## Route source(s) discovered
- **`rcm_mc/ui/_chartis_kit.py :: _DEFAULT_PALETTE_MODULES`** — the
  Cmd+K / Tools palette and the authoritative route manifest. Its
  comment-group headers map 1:1 to the seven PEdesk tool groups.
- Considered but not merged as separate manifests: `/module-index`
  (the ~150 `data_public` analytic modules — a secondary catalog) and
  the per-deal dynamic routes (handled by the dynamic matcher, not the
  static manifest). The palette is the single normalized source.

## Counts
- Total discovered routes: **72**
- Registry entries: **72** (one per discovered route; zero missing)
- Documented contexts: **42**
- Placeholder contexts: **30**
- Duplicate routes: **0**
- Routes that could not be categorized: **0** (all map to one of the 7 groups)
- Dynamic route contexts (not in the static manifest): Deal Dashboard,
  Partner Review, Deal IC Packet, Deal Red Flags, Analysis Workbench,
  Engagement Portal.

## Commands run + results
- `python -m rcm_mc.assistant.context.validate_page_context_coverage`
  → **PASS, exit 0** (0 missing, 0 invalid categories/confidence, 0
  duplicates, 0 missing titles/normalizedRoutes).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_pedesk_guide_page_context.py` → **9 passed**.
- Acceptance lookups verified: `?demo=steward` normalizes to
  `/diligence/risk-workbench`; `/deal/<id>`, `/deal/<id>/partner-review`,
  `/deal/<id>/ic-packet`, `/deal/<id>/red-flags`, `/analysis/<id>`,
  `/portal/<id>` resolve to generic contexts; trailing slash + hash
  normalize; unknown routes return the clean fallback.

## Placeholder routes (need source upgrade — next batches)
30 placeholders, e.g.: /source, /pe-intelligence, /deal-screening,
/conferences, /diligence/{thesis-pipeline, checklist, ingest,
benchmarks, root-cause, value, counterfactual, qoe-memo,
denial-prediction, physician-attrition, physician-eu, management,
exit-timing, covenant-stress, bridge-audit}, /engagements,
/deals-library, /market-intel, /research, /notes, /hold-analysis,
/corpus-backtest, /portfolio/{map, monitor}, /portfolio-analytics,
/market-data/state/CA.

## Remaining caveats
- Manual contexts deliberately describe *intent* and *interpretation*,
  not exact formulas. Anything not established from source is marked
  "Needs source documentation." — no invented math/lineage.
- `data_confidence` flags live-vs-illustrative honestly, but several
  manual entries use `mixed`/`unknown` pending source confirmation.
- The `/module-index` long-tail (~150 analytic modules) is intentionally
  out of scope for this manifest; fold in later if the Guide should
  cover them too.

## Next recommended batch to upgrade (highest value first)
1. Diligence Workspace placeholders: /diligence/{value, qoe-memo,
   counterfactual, exit-timing, covenant-stress, bridge-audit,
   denial-prediction} — core IC-path tools.
2. Pipeline: /source, /pe-intelligence, /deal-screening.
3. Research: /hold-analysis, /corpus-backtest, /market-intel.
4. Portfolio: /portfolio/map, /portfolio/monitor, /portfolio-analytics.

# Task 2 — Metric & Data Source Registries (2026-05-22)

- **Metrics created:** 54 (`METRIC_REGISTRY`) — financial/PE, revenue
  cycle, provider, hospital/HCRIS, risk/model (+ `ebitda_bridge`).
- **Data sources created:** 32 (`DATA_SOURCE_REGISTRY`) — public/external,
  uploaded/target, internal/system, special (+ `benchmark_prior`, added
  so the payer-stress page reference resolves).
- **Pages connected to metric/source ids:** 8 (hcris-xray, bridge-audit,
  payer-stress, denial-prediction, physician-eu, portfolio/monitor, data,
  methodology). `PageContext` gained optional `metric_ids` /
  `data_source_ids` (default empty — existing entries unaffected).
- **Lookups:** `get_metric_context`, `get_data_source_context` —
  case-insensitive, alias-aware, clean fallback.

## Commands + results
- `validate_page_context_coverage` → PASS (exit 0).
- `validate_guide_context_quality` → PASS (exit 0): 0 invalid metric/
  source refs, 0 duplicate ids, 0 ambiguous aliases. (33 metrics
  `needs_validation` and placeholder pages are allowed, not failures.)
- `py_compile` on the package → clean.
- `pytest tests/test_pedesk_guide_metric_data_context.py
  tests/test_pedesk_guide_page_context.py` → 20 passed.

## Caveats
- Most metric formulas are `needs_validation` or `inferred` by design —
  no model-specific formula is invented; standard textbook ratios are
  marked `inferred`.
- Removed the ambiguous bare alias "leakage" (claimed by both
  collections_leakage and referral_leakage) so it cleanly falls back.
- Many `data_confidence` values are `mixed`/`unknown` pending source
  confirmation. The `/module-index` ~150-module long-tail remains out of
  scope for the page manifest.

## Next recommended batch
- Upgrade more diligence placeholders to documented contexts and attach
  metric/source ids (qoe-memo, covenant-stress, exit-timing, value).
- Confirm exact formulas from code/methodology to promote key metrics
  from `inferred`/`needs_validation` → `documented`.

# Task 3 — Guide Context Packet layer (2026-05-22)

Single read-only builder that assembles all structured context the
future Guide needs to explain a page. No AI / Ollama / RAG / chat /
actions / DB memory / visual redesign / workbench port — text + lookups.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `guide_prompt_policy.py` | `GUIDE_PROMPT_POLICY` (frozen) + `GUIDE_IDENTITY`, `ALLOWED_BEHAVIOR`, `DISALLOWED_BEHAVIOR` (10), `DEFAULT_UNCERTAINTY_MESSAGE`, `policy_as_dict()`. The behavioral contract; carries no behavior. |
| `suggested_questions.py` | `get_suggested_questions_for_page(page_context)` — 5 defaults + category/data-source additions, deterministic, capped at 8. |
| `guide_context_packet.py` | `GuideContextPacket` dataclass + `build_guide_context_packet(route)` + `summarize_context_packet(packet)`. |

**Builder flow:** `get_page_context` → resolve metric contexts (explicit
`metric_ids`, else conservative match from `key_metrics` labels) → resolve
data-source contexts (same) → suggested questions → embed policy →
compute `context_quality` → record `missing_context_notes`. Never invents
formulas/lineage; unresolved items are recorded, not fabricated.

**`context_quality` precedence:** `missing` (no page ctx) → `placeholder`
(`source_confidence == needs_validation`) → `strong` (documented /
inferred_from_page **and** ≥1 linked metric/source) → `placeholder`
(≥3 core fields say "Needs source documentation.") → `partial`.

## Quality distribution (all 72 registry routes)
- **strong: 8** (the 8 metric/source-linked pages from Task 2)
- **partial: 2**
- **placeholder: 62**
- **missing: 0** (every registry route resolves; only off-manifest
  routes like `/unknown-route` grade `missing`)

## Commands + results
- `validate_page_context_coverage` → PASS (exit 0).
- `validate_guide_context_quality` → PASS (exit 0).
- `py_compile` on the package → clean.
- `pytest tests/test_pedesk_guide_context_packet.py` → 10 passed.
- `pytest tests/test_pedesk_guide_page_context.py
  tests/test_pedesk_guide_metric_data_context.py` → 20 passed (unchanged).

## Caveats
- Packet quality is honest, not flattering: 62/72 routes grade
  `placeholder` because their underlying page contexts are still
  placeholders (Task 1/2 backlog). Promoting them is a context-authoring
  task, not a packet-layer change.
- Conservative metric/source matching only resolves *registered* aliases;
  a page whose `key_metrics` are free-text prose won't auto-link (recorded
  in `missing_context_notes`). Explicit `metric_ids`/`data_source_ids`
  remain the reliable path.
- No endpoint is wired: this is infrastructure the future Guide endpoint
  imports. Building that endpoint (and any UI) is explicitly out of scope.

# Task 4 — Upgrade placeholder PageContexts from source (Priority A) (2026-05-22)

Read the actual page implementations (route handlers in `server.py`,
renderers in `rcm_mc/ui/`, page docstrings, headings, table columns, KPI
labels, data pulls) and authored conservative, source-grounded contexts
for the Priority A pages. No formulas/lineage invented; unknowns stay
"Needs source documentation." Scope: **Priority A only** (the spec
permits stopping here and reporting the next batch).

## Quality distribution (packet quality over all 72 registry routes)
- **Start:** strong 8 · partial 2 · placeholder 62 · missing 0
- **End:**   strong 23 · partial 2 · placeholder 47 · missing 0

Strong target (20+) reached. Partial-20+/placeholder-<35 stretch needs
Priority B/C (not in this PR, by design).

## Pages upgraded (Priority A) — 16 routes
Promoted to **strong** (filled core fields + linked reliable
metric_ids/data_source_ids): `/alerts`, `/watchlist`,
`/diligence/questions`, `/audit`, `/import`, `/pipeline`,
`/diligence/deal`, `/diligence/ic-packet`, `/portfolio`,
`/portfolio/risk-scan`, `/portfolio/heatmap`, `/lp-update`, `/app`
(added MOIC/IRR/covenant + portfolio_snapshot links).
Two **new** entries authored (were needs_validation stubs):
`/diligence/checklist`, `/diligence/qoe-memo`.
`/users` upgraded to **partial** (admin page — no analytic metric/source
to link; intentionally not strong).

## Conservatism calls worth noting
- **`/pipeline` correction:** the prior context claimed a
  "probability-weighted close value"; the actual `pipeline_page.py`
  shows a stage funnel (screening→…→closed/passed) over HCRIS public
  financials with **no** weighting. Rewritten to match source and noted
  that any weighting "needs source confirmation."
- **`/diligence/ic-packet` and `/diligence/qoe-memo` are NOT marked
  IC-ready / signed.** Source shows only a rendered view (browser
  Print → Save as PDF); the QoE engagement link writes a **DRAFT** only.
  Both contexts explicitly say to verify before IC use — no sign-off
  flow exists in source.
- **localStorage pages** (`/diligence/deal`, `/diligence/questions`)
  flagged as user-entered, browser-local — not server-side records.
- **`data_confidence`** set honestly: fixture-driven diligence pages →
  `mixed`; HCRIS-backed `/pipeline` → `public_benchmark_data`;
  user-entered import/profile pages → `user_entered_data`.

## Pages still placeholder (47) — next batches
- **Priority B (14 placeholder):** /source, /screen-adjacent sourcing,
  /pe-intelligence, /deal-screening, /find-comps, /conferences,
  /diligence/{thesis-pipeline, benchmarks, root-cause, value,
  risk-workbench, counterfactual, compare}, /screening/bankruptcy-survivor.
- **Priority C (19 placeholder):** /library, /deals-library, /comparables,
  /market-rates, /research, /notes, /sector-momentum, /irr-dispersion,
  /hold-analysis, /comparable-outcomes, /bear-cases, /regulatory-calendar,
  /market-intel, /corpus-backtest, /backtest, /portfolio/map,
  /portfolio-analytics + remainder.
- Plus other non-priority placeholders in the long tail.

## Blocked / not upgraded
- **`/home`** is not a discovered route (not in the registry) — no page
  to read, so nothing authored. (`/app` is the actual command center.)
- **`/users`** stays `partial` by design — it's platform administration,
  not an analytic page; no registry metric/source applies.

## Commands + results
- `python -m rcm_mc.assistant.context.validate_page_context_coverage`
  → PASS (exit 0).
- `python -m rcm_mc.assistant.context.validate_guide_context_quality`
  → PASS (exit 0): 0 invalid metric refs, 0 invalid source refs, 0
  duplicate ids, 0 ambiguous aliases.
- `py_compile` on the context package → clean.
- `pytest tests/test_pedesk_guide_page_context.py
  tests/test_pedesk_guide_metric_data_context.py
  tests/test_pedesk_guide_context_packet.py` → **30 passed**.

## Caveats
- All upgrades are `inferred_from_page` unless the page/source explicitly
  documented behavior (`/alerts`, `/pipeline` data, `/portfolio`,
  `/portfolio/risk-scan`, `/lp-update`, `/app` keep `documented` where
  the source supports it).
- No exact formulas were added; model-logic summaries describe intent and
  point to the implementing module for specifics.

# Task 4B — Upgrade placeholder PageContexts from source (Priority B) (2026-05-22)

Read the actual page implementations (server.py handlers, `rcm_mc/ui/`
renderers, page docstrings, headings, table columns, KPI labels, and what
each handler pulls) and authored conservative, source-grounded contexts
for the Priority B sourcing / screening / diligence-interpretation pages.
No formulas/lineage invented.

## Quality distribution (packet quality over all 72 registry routes)
- **Start (after PR #559):** strong 23 · partial 2 · placeholder 47 · missing 0
- **End:** strong 36 · partial 3 · placeholder 33 · missing 0

## Pages upgraded (all 15 Priority B routes)
Promoted to **strong** (filled core fields + linked reliable
metric_ids/data_source_ids): `/source`, `/screen`,
`/predictive-screener`, `/deal-screening`, `/find-comps`,
`/diligence/thesis-pipeline`, `/diligence/benchmarks`,
`/diligence/root-cause`, `/diligence/value`, `/diligence/risk-workbench`,
`/diligence/counterfactual`, `/diligence/compare`,
`/screening/bankruptcy-survivor`.
Upgraded to **partial** (no analytic metric/source applies, by nature):
`/pe-intelligence` (a methodology/registry hub), `/conferences` (a
curated reference calendar).
Nine of these were previously `needs_validation` stubs now fully authored;
six already had minimal manual entries that were expanded.

## Conservatism calls worth noting
- **`/predictive-screener`:** kept as model ESTIMATES from public HCRIS,
  not observed target data; noted point estimates have no stated CI and
  are not validated against realized outcomes (`data_confidence =
  model_estimate`).
- **`/pe-intelligence`:** described as a module registry / codified-judgment
  catalog, explicitly NOT validated prediction; per-deal output lives on
  deal routes.
- **`/diligence/benchmarks`:** separated the target's own KPI VALUES
  (observed from claims) from the external peer BENCHMARK bands; flagged
  that claims are fixtures on this page.
- **`/diligence/risk-workbench`:** flagged `?demo=steward` as a specific
  named historical replay (Steward 2016), not a generic example, plus the
  `?print=1` mode.
- **`/screening/bankruptcy-survivor`:** described as deterministic
  pattern-match SIGNAL (falsifiable structural claims + named precedent),
  explicitly NOT a prediction/verdict; "pre-screening only."
- **`/diligence/value`:** UNDERWRITTEN forward opportunity, NOT realized
  value; contract/CMS rates are synthetic demo inputs.
- **`/diligence/counterfactual`:** what-if / sensitivity ("what would
  change the conclusion"), NOT an action recommender.
- **`/find-comps` and `/diligence/compare`:** comparable MATCHING, not an
  approved/governed comp set; both run on seeded/demo fixtures
  (`/diligence/compare` → `data_confidence = demo_or_fixture`).
- **`/source` vs `/screen` vs `/predictive-screener`:** thesis-fit ranking
  vs metric filter vs ML estimate — none marked "predictive" beyond what
  source supports; all on public HCRIS.

## Pages still placeholder (33) — next batch (Priority C + long tail)
Priority C examples: /library, /deals-library, /comparables, /market-rates,
/research, /notes, /sector-momentum, /irr-dispersion, /hold-analysis,
/comparable-outcomes, /bear-cases, /regulatory-calendar, /market-intel,
/corpus-backtest, /backtest, /portfolio/map, /portfolio-analytics, plus
the remaining non-priority long tail.

## Pages partial / blocked
- `/pe-intelligence`, `/conferences` stay **partial** by design — neither
  is an analytic page with a registry metric/source to link.

## Commands + results
- `python -m rcm_mc.assistant.context.validate_page_context_coverage`
  → PASS (exit 0).
- `python -m rcm_mc.assistant.context.validate_guide_context_quality`
  → PASS (exit 0): 0 invalid metric/source refs, 0 duplicate ids, 0
  ambiguous aliases.
- `py_compile` on the context package → clean.
- `pytest tests/test_pedesk_guide_page_context.py
  tests/test_pedesk_guide_metric_data_context.py
  tests/test_pedesk_guide_context_packet.py` → **30 passed**.

## Caveats
- All Priority B upgrades are `inferred_from_page` except `/screen` and
  `/deal-screening`, where the handler/module docstring explicitly
  documents the behavior (`documented`).
- `data_confidence` set honestly: fixture-driven diligence pages →
  `mixed` (or `demo_or_fixture` for `/diligence/compare`); HCRIS sourcing →
  `public_benchmark_data`; `/predictive-screener` → `model_estimate`;
  methodology/reference pages → `unknown`.
- No exact formulas added; model-logic summaries describe intent and point
  to the implementing module.
